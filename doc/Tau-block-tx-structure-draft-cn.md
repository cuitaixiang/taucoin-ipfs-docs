# TAU - Unlimited P2P File Sharing
```
User experienses:= {
- File imported to TAU will be compressed and chopped by TGZ, which includes directory, pictures and videos. Chopped file pieces will be added into AMT (Array Mapped Trie) with a `fileAMTroot` as return. Filed downloaded could be decompressed to original structure.  Files downloaded is considerred imported. Imported file can be seeded to a chain or pinned in local. TAU app does not provide native media player to avoid legal issue. 
- Community creates community chains for file sharing using own coins. The chain ID is the creator's `TAUaddress`+random(1,000,000,000). Community chains can announce relay on community chain and TAU main chain. 
- TAU mainnet does not hold files, only provide relay management service. Potentially to annouce relay for mulitple communities or regions, assuming millions of community established file sharing. Relay config will be a busy service. 
- All chain addresses are derivative from TAU private key. Nodes use IPFS peers ID for ipv4 tcp transport. (the association of TAUaddr and IPFS address is through signature using ipfs RSA private key).
}

Business model:= {
- Tau foundation will develop TAU App and provide relays, in return for admob/mopub ads income to cover AWS data cost. Any one can config relay permission-lessly on both TAU and community chain. 
- Individual nodes will see ads to keep using data for free, the more data upload, the less ads to see. In app, show a stats of uploaded data, download data and ads time. 
- Taucoin price will rise when relay configuration in high demand. 
}
Launch steps:={
- Free community creation for file sharing. TAUTest coin is an initial test by TAU dev. At this stage, TAU provide static relay service via AWS. 
- Tau mainnet turns on for relays operation.
}
```
## Four main processes exist in architecture
* A. Response with predicted `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot, which is a hamt cbor.cid. 
* B. Collect votings from chain peers to find the chainid's safety state root. 
* C. File Downloader.
* D. Reponse to downloader the fileAMT trie. 

## Tries
On community chain:
* chain contract: `ChainID`ContractAMTroot is the root for **AMT** trie to store history contracts, which is blockchain in old concept.
* chain contract result: `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot is the root for **HAMT** trie for the chain state; contract and results are connected in each state transition. 
```
- future state/`ChainID`ContractAMTroot/K-V -> `ChainID`ContractAMTroot
- `ChainID`ContractAMTroot/`count`/state -> `ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot
```
* file AMT: the root for AMT trie for chopping and storing the file.

On TAU chain: 
* relay: RelayAMTroot is the root for AMT trie for all relays, while relay is not chain specific.

## Global Context: stored in levelDB
It helps to make process internal data access efficient. 
* `ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot; // this is constantly updated by voting process B. When most difficulty chain is found or verified after voting process.
* `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot; // after found safety, this is the new contract state, which is a hamt node.cid
* `ChainID`ContractAMTroot;
* UserChainList[]; // a list of Chains to follow/mine by users.
* UserFileAMTlist[]; // a list for imported and downloaded files trie
* `ChainID`PeerList[]; // list of known IPFS peers for the chain by users.
* RelayList[]; // a list of known relays from TAU chain; initially will be hard-coded to use AWS EC2 relay.

## Concept explain
```
- Miner is what nodes call itself, in CBC POT all miners predicting future; Sender is what nodes call other peers. 
- Safety is the CBC concept of the safe and agreed history. The future contract result is a CBC prediction. 
- Mutable range is one week for now. 
- HamtGraphyRelaySync(relay multiaddress, remotePeerIPFS addr, chainID, cbor.cid, selector); // replace the relay circuit. When cbor.cid is null, it means asking peer for the prediction, the target's future `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot.
- AMTgraphRelaySync(relay multiaddress, remote ipfs peer, CID, selector); CID can not be null. 
- File operation transaction, FileAMTRoot creation and seeding, related nounce and seeders accessible through wormhole.
- Principle of traverse, once in a relay+peer communication, we will not incur another recursive process to a new relay+peer to get supporting evidence. if some Key-value are missing to prevent validation, just abort process to go next randomness peer. This is the depth priority.  However for the fileAMTroot search, it is the width priority to do paralell download using all seeders. 

- Address system: 
- TAU public key: the base for all address generation;
- Community chain ID: Tgenesisaddress + random(1,000,000,000);
- Community chains peer address format : `chainID` + TAU address; 
```
## Wormhole - Keys in the HAMT, hashed keys are wormhole inito contract AMT trie to get history proof. 
```
`ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Nounce; //  balance and POT power for each address
`ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Balance
`ChainID``Tsender``Nounce`FileAMTroot // when user follow a chain address, they can traverse its files through changing nounce. 
`FileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounce // for each file, this is the total number of registerred seeders, first seeding is the creation.
`FileAMTroot``ChainID``Seeding`Nounce`IPFSPeer // the seeding peer id for the file. 
```
## community chain
**Genesis** with parameters: block size in number of txs, block time, chain nick name, coins total - default is 1 million,  relay bootstrap.  // initial mining peers is established through issue coins to those addresses, such as TAU-Torrent has initial addresses.
```
* levelDB.add `ChainID`contractAMTroot = amt_new node(). // root for contact AMT
* generate genesis contract, 
ChainID = `Tminer`+ random(1,000,000,000)
X = `ChainID`contractAMTRoot.add({
`ChainID`SafetyContractResultRoot = null; // genesis is built from null.
blocksize; // default 5
blocktime; // default 10 minutes
initial difficulty; // ???
chain nickname; // hello world chain
total coins; // default 1,000,000
initial relaylist json({multi address}); // relay bootstrap /ipv4/tcp
telegramGroup; // https://t.me/taucoin for organizing the community.
}); // X.

* new `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot = new hamt.node();
* hamt_add(ChainID,`ChainID`);
* hamt_add(`ChainID`contractAMTroot, `ChainID`contractAMTRoot.put(cbor);); 
* hamt_add(`Tminer`Balance, 1,000,000); 
* hamt_add(`Tminer`Nounce, 1);
* hamt_add(genesisAddress, `Tminer`); // add genesis address wormhole
* hamt_add(other KVs); // initial chain address.
* `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot.put(cbor); // for responding to voting.

* levelDB.`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot = null;
* levelDB.`ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot=`ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot; 
* levelDB.UserChainList.add(`ChainID`)
* levelDB.`ChainID`PeerList.add(`Tminer);
* levelDB.RelayList.add({aws relays by taucoin dev});
```
## A. One miner receives GraphSync request from a relay. 
Miner does not know which peer requesting them, because the relay shields the peers. Two types of requests: "chainIDContractResultStateRoot" and `fileAMTroot`. 
### A.1 for future `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot
```
1. Receive the `ChainID` from a graphRelaySync call
2. If the node follows on this chain, return leveldb.`ChainID`contractResultStateRoot, which was generated in B process step(6).
```
### A.2 From a file downloader 
caller with graphRelaySyncï¼ˆ relay, peer, chainID, `fileAMTroot`, selector(range of the trie))
If the `fileAMTroot` exists, then return the blocks according to the range. 

## B. Collect votings from peers: this process has two modes: miner and non-miner: 
In the peer randome walking, no recursively switching peers inside the loop, it relies on top random working. In the process of voting, the loose coupling along time is good practise to keep the new miners learning without influcence from external. This process is for multiple chain, multiple relay and mulitple peers.  
### B1. non-mining users, which are on battery power or telecom data service. 
0. release android wake-lock and wifi-lock
```
code section H:
1. random walk to next followed chain id; random walk connect to a next relay in the chainlist using Kademlia selection.  
2. through relay, randomly request a chainPeer from chainIDpeerlist for the future contract result state root.  

graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=`ChainID`contractAMTRoot)); 
// when CID is NULL,  - 0 means the relay will request y:= `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot from the peer via tcp

3. traverse history contract and states until mutable range.

stateroot = y
(*) 
graphsyncAMT(stateroot/`ChainID`contractAMTroot) 
stateroot= `ChainID`contractAMTroot/count/`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot // recursive getting previous stateRoot to move into history
graphsyncHAMT(stateroot)
goto (*) until the mutable range; // 
goto step (2); 

when connection timeout or hit any error, go to step(1)

4. accounting the new voting, update the CBC safety root: levelDB_update(SafetyContractResultStateRoot, voted SAFETY), 
``` 
5. build a future `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot; use B2 - step 5.
6. then go to step (1).


### B2. mining user, which requires wifi and power plugged, while missing wifi or plug will switch to non-mining mode B1. 

0. turn on android wake-lock and wifi-lock
```
copy code section H from B1.
```
5. predict new future contract. 
```
X = {
`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot 32; // link to current safety state node.cid, and move to generate future
contractNumber = AMT_get_count(`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot/`ChainID`contractAMTRoot/number) +1;
version,8; 
timestamp, 4; 
base target, 8; // for POT calc
cumulative difficulty,8 ; 
generation signature,32; 
ChainIDminerAddress, 20; 
Nounce, 8; // mining is treated as a tx sending to self
 `ChainIDminerAddress`IPFSsig; //IPFS signature on `ChainIDminerAddress` to proof association. Verifier decodes siganture to derive IPFSaddress QM..; 
ChainIDminerOtherInfo, 128 bytes; //nick name.
TXsJSON, flexible bytes; 
= { //original tx from voting collection: wiring and file operation.
nounce, 8;
version,8, "0x1" as default;
timestamp,4,tx expire in 24 hours;
txfee;
`ChainIDsenderAddress`IPFSsig; //IPFS signature on `ChainIDsenderAddress` to proof association. Verifier decodes siganture to derive IPFSaddress QM..; 
ChainIDsenderOtherInfo, 128 bytes;  // nick name.

FileAMTRoot;
tx sender signature;
// the File processing
// 1. tgz then use ipfs block standard size e.g. 250k to chop the data to m pieceis
// 2. newNode.amt(1,piece(1)); loop to newNode.hamt(m,piece(m));
// 3. FileAMTroot=AMT_flush_put()
// 4. return FileAMTroot to contract Json. 
}
 
signature , 65:r: 32 bytes, s: 32 bytes, v: 1 byte
}  // finish X.
```
* hamt_update(`ChainID`contractAMTroot, chainIDcontractAMTroot.add(X)); 

#### contract execute results
##### output coinbase tx
* hamt_update(`Tminer`Balance,`Tminer`Balance + amount); // update balance 
* hamt_update(`Tminer`Nounce,`Tminer`Nounce + 1); // for the coinbase tx nounce increase
##### output Coins Wiring tx, both sender and receive increase power, this is good for new users to produce contract.
Account operation
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Balance,`Tsender`Balance - amount - txfee); 
* hamt_update(`Ttxreceiver`Balance,`Ttxreceiver`Balance + amount);
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Nounce,`Tsender`Nounce + 1);
* hamt_update(`Treceiver`Nounce,`Treceiver`Nounce++);
##### File creation and seeding transaction
Account operation
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Balance,`Tsender`Balance-txfee); 
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Nounce, `Tsender`Nounce + 1);
File operation
* fileAMTroot = new AMTnode().put(file) // tgz, chop and put file into AMT trie, return the root
* hamt_upate(`fileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounce, `fileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounce+1);
* hamt_update(`ChainID``Tsender``Nounce`FileAMTroot, fileAMTroot); // when user follow tsender, can traver its files.
* hamt_update(`FileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounceIPFSpeer) // seeding peer ipfs id, the first seeder is the creator of the file.

6. Put new generated states into  cbor block, levelDB.add `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot = hamt_put(cbor); // this is the  return to requestor for future state prediction, it is a block.cid
7. random walk until connect to a next relay
through graphrelaySync randomly request a chainPeer (get chainPeerListIPFSaddr) for the future receipt state root candidate 
```
graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=`ChainID`contractAMTroot)); 
```
8. mining by following the most difficult chain: if received `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot/`ChainID`contractAMTroot shows a more difficult chain, then verify this chain's transactions for ONEWEEK range.
9. If verification succesful, levelDB_update(`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot, `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot), go to step (5) to get a new state prediction; Else go to step (7)
10. if network-disconnected from internet 48 hours, go to step (1).
## C. File Downloader
```
input (`fileAMTroot`); // this is for single thread download

From `fileAMTroot`, loop the seeder nouce, loop the nounce;
{ random walk on all relays

graphRelaySync(relay, chainID, chainPeerIPFSID, `fileAMTroot`, selector(field:=section 1..m))

until finish all relays or find the chainPeer
}
```
## App UI

### Home
- according to the following list, display files uploaded and its description. users can follow sender or blacklist them. 
### Files, this is where watching the ads
- import files
- seeding files to chains
- download stats
- pin a file, no directory at now, sort by dates and size
### Follow
- follow chain
- follow members
* this is the folder stucture: /chain/members/files[1..nounce] and its messages.
### Mining and account balances on different chains. 
- coins mining config

# To do
## TAU Chain
TAU has only function that is relay configuration and related data payment settlement.
* wormhole
- relay nounce/ relaynounce = ...
- hamt_update(relayNounce, relayNounce +1)
- hamt_add(RelayNounceAddr, new relay info)
## Kademlia on relay and peers selection
## community relay annoucement on community chain. 
## file operation commands
```
File operation command:
//  rootCreate: create hamt node for the file, return the root IPLD cid and number of blocks, set rootNounce = 1
//  - cat file| rootCreate -compress -chunk size -type file/video/voice -video_preview
//  e.g  cat starwar.mp4 | rootCreate -type video -video_preview; // return root hash and size of the preview
//  rootSeeding: graphRelaySync hamt node to local, and provide turn on seeding or off, set rootNounce ++
//  - rootSeeding fileRoot -seeding on/off
```
