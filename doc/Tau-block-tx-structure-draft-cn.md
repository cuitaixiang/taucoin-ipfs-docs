# TAU - P2P File Sharing Blockchain
```
User experienses:= {
- File uploaded will be compressed to TGZ, which includes directory, pictures and videos. TGZ will be choped and added into AMT (Array Mapped Trie) with a `fileAMTroot` as return. TAU app does not provide native media player to avoid legal issue. Filed downloaded will be decompressed to original format. Users will not feel the TGZ process.
- Community creates community chains with own coins for file sharing. Community chain ID is the creator's `TAUaddress`+random(1,000,000,000). Community chains can announce relay for own use on community chain as well. 
- TAU mainnet does not hold files, only provide relay management service. Potentially to annouce relay for mulitple communities or regions. Assume millions of community established file sharing. Relay config is a busy service. 
- All chain addresses are derivative from TAU private key. Nodes use IPFS peers ID for internet connection (the association of TAUaddr and IPFS address is by signature using ipfs RSA private key).
}

Business model:= {
- Tau foundation will develop TAU App and provide relays for free, in return for admob/mopub ads income to cover AWS data cost. Any one can add relay permission-lessly on TAU chain. 
- Members can install and announce own relays to serve certain chains on TAU or community chains.
- Individual nodes will see ads to keep the data for free, the more data upload, the less ads to see. In app, show a stats of uploaded data, download data and ads time. 
- Taucoin price will rise when relay configuration in high demand. 
}
Launch steps:={
- Free community creation for file sharing. TAUTest coin is an initial test. At this stage, TAU provide static relay service via AWS. 
- Tau main net turn on for community relays.
}

## Three main processes exist in architecture
* A. Response with predicted `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot, which is a hamt cbor.cid. 
* B. Collect votings from chain peers to find the chainid's safety state root. 
* C. File Downloader.

## Tries
On community chain:
* chain contract: `ChainID`ContractAMTroot is the root for **AMT** trie to store history contracts, which is blockchain in old concept.
* chain contract result: `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot is the root for **HAMT** trie for the chain state; contract and receipt are interconnected in each state transition. 
* file AMT: the root for AMT trie for chopping and store the file.

On TAU chain: 
* relay: RelayAMTroot is the root for AMT trie for relays, while relay is not chain specific.

Trie elements linking
* future state/`ChainID`ContractAMTroot -> `ChainID`ContractAMTroot
* `ChainID`ContractAMTroot/`count`/state -> `ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot

## Global Context: stored in levelDB
It helps to make process internal data access efficient. 
* `ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot; // this is constantly updated by voting process B. When most difficulty chain is found or verified after voting process.
* `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot; // after found safety, this is the new contract state, which is a hamt node.cid
* `ChainID`ContractAMTroot;
* UserChainList[]; // a list of Chains to follow/mine by users.
* UserFileAMTlist[]; // a list for storing user kept files 
* `ChainID`PeerList[]; // list of known peers for the chain by users.
* RelayList[]; // a list of known relays from TAU chain; initially will be hard-coded to use AWS EC2 relay.

## Concept explain
```
- Miner is what nodes call itself, in CBC POT all miners predicting future; Sender is what nodes call other peers. 
- Safety is the CBC concept of the safe and agreed history milestone. The future contract result is a CBD prediction. 
- Mutable range is one week for now. 
- HamtGraphyRelaySync(relay multiaddress, remotePeerIPFS addr, chainID, cbor.cid, selector); // replace the relay circuit. When cbor.cid is null, it means asking peer for the prediction, the target's future `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot.
- AMTgraphRelaySync(relay multiaddress, remote ipfs peer, CID, selector); CID can not be null. 
- Address system: 
- TAU public key: the base for all address generation;
- Community chain ID: Tgenesisaddress + random(1,000,000,000);
- Community chains peer address format : `chainID` + TAU address; 
- File operation transaction, FileAMTRoot creation and seeding, related seeders accessible through wormhole.
- Principle of traverse, once in a relay+peer communication, we will not incur another recursive process to a new relay+peer to get supporting evidence. if some vars are missing, just abort process to go next randomness contact. depth priority.  However for the fileAMT search, it is the width priority to do paralell download. 
```
## Wormhole - Keys in the HAMT, hashed keys are wormhole inito contract AMT trie to get history proof. 
```
`ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Nounce // indexing balance and pot power for each address
`ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Balance
`ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Nounce`ChainID`contractAMTroot // contract entry for a transaction

`FileAMTroot``ChainID``SeedingNounce // for each file, this is the history of the seeding, first seeding is the creation. e.g. `Fiuweh87..x`SeedingNounce = 00189
`FileAMTroot``ChainID``Seeding`Nounce`IPFSPeer // the seeding peer id for the file. eg. `Fiuweh87..x`Seeding`00187`IPFSpeer= QM....
```
## community chain - supports file sharing commands
**Genesis** generating with parameters: block size in number of txs, block time, chain nick name, coins total default is 1 million, initial peers ipfs address. // relay bootstrap is initially written in software until TAU mainet on.  
```
* levelDB.add `ChainID`contractAMTroot = amt_new node(). // root for contact AMT
* generate genesis contract, 
ChainID = `Tminer`+ random(1,000,000,000)
X = `ChainID`contractAMTRoot.add({
`ChainID`SafetyContractResultRoot = null; // genesis is built from null.
blocksize; // default 5
blocktime; // default 10 minutes
initial difficulty; // ???
chain nickname; // hello world chain
total coins; // default 1,000,000
initial IPFS peers json({IPFS address});
initial relaylist json({multi address});
telegramGroup; // https://t.me/taucoin for organizing the community.
}); // X.

* new `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot = new hamt.node();
* hamt_add(ChainID,`ChainID`);
* hamt_add(`ChainID`contractAMTroot, `ChainID`contractAMTRoot.put(cbor);); 
* hamt_add(`Tminer`Balance, 1,000,000); 
* hamt_add(`Tminer`Nounce, 1);
* hamt_add(genesisAddress, `Tminer`); // add genesis address wormhole
* hamt_add(other KVs); // initial chain address.
* `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot.put(cbor); // for responding to voting.

* levelDB.`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot = null;
* levelDB.`ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot=`ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot; 
* levelDB.UserChainList.add(`ChainID`)
* levelDB.`ChainID`PeerList.add(`Tminer);
* levelDB.RelayList.add({aws relays by taucoin dev});

```
## A. One miner receives GraphSync request from a relay. 
Miner does not know which peer requesting them, because the relay shields the peers. Two types of requests: "chainIDContractResultStateRoot" and `fileAMTroot`. 
### A.1 for future `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot
```
1. Receive the `ChainID` from a graphRelaySync call
2. If active on this chain, return leveldb.`ChainID`contractResultStateRoot, which was generated in B process hamt_put
```
### A.2 For file relay, from a file downloader running a graphRelaySyncï¼ˆ relay, peer, chainID, `fileAMTroot`, selector). 
If the `fileAMTroot` exists, then return the blocks. 

## B. Collect votings from peers: this process has two modes: miner and non-miner: 
In the peer randome walking, no recursively switching peers inside the loop, it relies on top random working. In the process of voting, the loose coupling along time is good practise to keep the new miners learning without influcence from external. This process is for multiple chain, multiple relay and mulitple peers.  
### B1. non-mining users, which are on battery power or telecom data service. 

0. release android wake-lock and wifi-lock
```
code section H:
1. random walk to next followed chain id; random walk connect to a next relayAMT in the chainlist using Kademlia selection.  
2. through relay, randomly request a chainPeer from chainIDpeerlist for the future contract result state root.  

graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=`ChainID`contractAMTRoot)); 
// when CID is NULL,  - 0 means the relay will request `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot from the peer via tcp

3. traverse history contract and states until mutable range.

stateroot = `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot
(*) 
graphsyncAMT(`ChainID`contractAMTroot) 
contractJson = amt_get(contractAMTroot )
stateroot= contractJSON/SafetyContractResultStateRoot // recursive getting previous stateRoot to move into history
graphsyncHAMT(SafetyContractResultStateRoot) 
contractAMTroot = hamt_get(stateroot, contractAMTRoot)
goto (*) until the mutable range; // 
goto step (2); 

when connection timeout or hit any error, go to step(1)

4. accounting the new voting, update the CBC safety root: levelDB_update(SafetyContractResultStateRoot, voted SAFETY), 
``` 
5. build a future contractResultState; use B2 - step 5.
6. then go to step (1).


### B2. mining user, which requires wifi and power plugged, while missing wifi or plug will switch to non-mining mode B1. 

0. turn on android wake-lock and wifi-lock
```
copy code section H from B1.
```
5. predict new future contract. 
```
X = {
SafetyContractResultStateRoot 32; // link to current safety state node.cid, and move to generate future
contractNumber = AMT_get_count(`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot/`ChainID`contractAMTRoot/number) +1;
version,8; 
timestamp, 4; 
base target, 8; // for POT calc
cumulative difficulty,8 ; 
generation signature,32; 
ChainIDminerAddress, 20; 
Nounce, 8; // mining is treated as a tx sending to self
 `ChainIDminerAddress`IPFSsig; //IPFS signature on `ChainIDminerAddress` to proof association. Verifier decodes siganture to derive IPFSaddress QM..; 
ChainIDminerOtherInfo, 128 bytes;
TXsJSON, flexible bytes; 
= { //original tx from voting collection: wiring and file operation.
nounce, 8;
version,8, "0x1" as default;
timestamp,4,tx expire in 24 hours;
txfee;
`ChainIDsenderAddress`IPFSsig; //IPFS signature on `ChainIDsenderAddress` to proof association. Verifier decodes siganture to derive IPFSaddress QM..; 
ChainIDsenderOtherInfo, 128 bytes;

FileAMTRoot;
tx sender signature;
// the File processing
// 1. tgz then use ipfs block standard size e.g. 250k to chop the data to m pieceis
// 2. newNode.amt(1,piece(1)); loop to newNode.hamt(m,piece(m));
// 3. FileAMTroot=AMT_flush_put()
// 4. return FileAMTroot to contract Json. 
}
 
signature , 65:r: 32 bytes, s: 32 bytes, v: 1 byte
}  // finish X.
```
* hamt_update(`ChainID`contractAMTroot, chainIDcontractAMTroot.add(X)); 

#### contract execute results
##### output coinbase tx
* hamt_update(`Tminer`Balance,`Tminer`Balance + amount); // update balance 
* hamt_update(`Tminer`Nounce,`Tminer`Nounce + 1); // for the coinbase tx nounce increase
##### output Coins Wiring tx, both sender and receive increase power, this is good for new users to produce contract.
Account operation
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Balance,`Tsender`Balance - amount - txfee); 
* hamt_update(`Ttxreceiver`Balance,`Ttxreceiver`Balance + amount);
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Nounce,`Tsender`Nounce + 1);
* hamt_update(`Treceiver`Nounce,`Treceiver`Nounce++);
##### File creation and seeding transaction
Account operation
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Balance,`Tsender`Balance-txfee); 
* hamt_update(`Tsender`Nounce++)
File operation
* fileAMTroot = new AMTnode().put(file) // tgz, chop and put file into AMT trie, return the root
* `fileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounce++  
* `FileAMTroot``ChainID`SeedingNounceIPFSpeer // seeding peer ipfs id, the first seeder is the creator of the file.
#### setup wormhole for contract entry from transactions
* `ChainID``Tsender/receiver`Nounce`ChainID`contractAMTroot = `ChainID`contractAMTroot // contract entry for a transaction

6. Put new generated states into  cbor block, levelDB.add `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot = hamt_put(cbor); // this is the  return to requestor for future state prediction, it is a block.cid
7. random walk until connect to a next relay
through graphrelaySync randomly request a chainPeer (get chainPeerListIPFSaddr) for the future receipt state root candidate 
```
graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=`ChainID`contractAMTroot)); 
```
8. mining by following the most difficult chain: if received `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot/`ChainID`contractAMTroot shows a more difficult chain, then verify this chain's transactions for ONEWEEK range.
9. If verification succesful, levelDB_update(`ChainID`SafetyContractResultStateRoot, `ChainID`ContractResultStateRoot), go to step (5) to get a new state prediction; Else go to step (7)
10. if network-disconnected from internet 48 hours, go to step (1).
## C. File Downloader
```
input (`fileAMTroot`); // this is for single thread download

From `fileAMTroot`, loop the seeder nouce, loop the nounce;
{ random walk on all relays

graphRelaySync(relay, chainID, chainPeerIPFSID, `fileAMTroot`, selector(field:=section 1..m))

until finish all relays or find the chainPeer
}
```
# To do
## TAU Chain
TAU has only function that is relay configuration and related data payment settlement.
- wormhole
relay nounce/ relaynounce = ...
* hamt_update(relayNounce, relayNounce +1)
* hamt_add(RelayNounceAddr, new relay info)
## Kademlia on relay and peers selection
## community relay annoucement on community chain. 
## file operation commands
```
File operation command:
//  rootCreate: create hamt node for the file, return the root IPLD cid and number of blocks, set rootNounce = 1
//  - cat file| rootCreate -compress -chunk size -type file/video/voice -video_preview
//  e.g  cat starwar.mp4 | rootCreate -type video -video_preview; // return root hash and size of the preview
//  rootSeeding: graphRelaySync hamt node to local, and provide turn on seeding or off, set rootNounce ++
//  - rootSeeding fileRoot -seeding on/off
```
