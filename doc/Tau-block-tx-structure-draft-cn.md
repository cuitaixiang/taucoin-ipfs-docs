# TAU - decentralized cloud
```
User experienses:= {
data upload format include all types - directory, pictures and videos, 
data download from swarm and export to specific types eg mp4 with play media in app to avoid legal issue; 
community genesis independant coins for file sharing; community members can decide use tau relay annoucned on tau main chain or own relay setup. 
TAU mainnet does not hold files.
}
Business model:= {
TAU community decentral nodes will provide relay services charging TAU coins.
Tau foundation will develop TAU App and provide public relays for free, in return to get ads views. 
Community can install own relay restricted to serve certain chain ID, configuerable for charging policy and service restrictions then annouce that in tau chain. 
all chain address are derivative from TAU private key and use IPFS peers ID for internet connection (the association of TAUaddr and IPFSaddr is by signature on TAUaddr by ipfs private key
}
Launch steps:={
Free community creation for exchange data, such as TAUTest as initial test.
Tau nodes keeps graphyRelaySync logs in levelDB.
}
```
## Three processes exists: 
* A. Response with future ContractReceiptStateRoot; 
* B. Collect votings from peers; 
* C. File Downloader.
## Global Context: store in levelDB
```
* Safety SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot; // this is constantly updated by voting collecting process B. When most difficulty chain is found or verified after voting process.
* ContractReceiptStateRoot; // after found safety, this is the new contract state hamt node.cid
* RelayList is a list of known relays through Kademlia and TAU chain info; 
* ChainList is a list of Chains to follow selected by user
* PeerList[chain ID] is list of known peers for the chain

```
## Concept
```
. Miner is what nodes call themself, in CBC POT all miners predicting future; Sender is what nodes call other peers.
Safety is the CBC concept of the safe and agreed history milestone.
. Mutable range is one week.
. Community chain ID: Tgenesisaddress+ random number+Tgenesisaddress; new hamt node built with genesis state; if a community chain want to be searched through mainchain, it need to make an gensis annoucment with genesis address on tau chain, also with several bootstrap miners ipfs address, 
. Community chains peer address format : chain ID+own address; 
. TAU address: T.....
. After file published, other peers commenting is the seeding indication, which means hosting this file. 
. HamtGraphyRelaySync(relay multiaddress, remotePeerIPFS addr, chainID, cbor.cid, selector); // replace the relay circuit, relay server will setup connection to peers. when cbor.cid is null, then asking for the prediction cid, the peer's ContractReceiptStateRoot.
. Address system: 
. TAU private key: the base for all address; TAU public Key hash to TAU address for main chain;
. FileRoot and nounce, the community is designed for handle file sharing, rather than list all tx, it list files and seeders in global key-value pair
. TAU is the boot strap for community chain. community chain claim initial genesis and miner info on TAU. Kademlia DHT is used to get initial relay for communtiy genesis addresses. before tau launch, we provide fixed relay for community chain. 
```
# I. community chain
genesis block: block size in number of txs, frequency, chain name, coins total, relay bootstrap. 
hamt_new node().
hamt_add(contractJson, {});
hamt_put  -> ContractReceitpStateRoot
add(genesisState,ContractReceitpStateRoot)

## A One miner receives GraphSync request from a relay. 
Miner does not know which peer contacting, because of the relay covers the peers. Two types of requests: stateRoot and file.
### A.1 for future ContractReceiptStateRoot
```
1. Receive the (genesis address); // this is the chain ID, TAU is 0x0;
2. If active on this chain, return: the future contractReceiptStateRoot for this chain, which is generated in B hamt_put
```
### A.2 For file relay, from a graphSync of a graphRelaySyncï¼ˆ relay, peer, chainID, cid, selector). 
File relay receive request for graphsync on content. graphsyncRelay(peerID, fileroot, selelctor_range). no need to setup connection to peer through relay, since know the peerID and root. file relay will setup connection will peers do a secondary graphysync
If successful, File relay will log this in
it will as well response with log root, log is the proof of graph sync history, each new TAU address can get a mininum service from hosts such as 1G, it is configurable in the sendersProfile json. File content trie is ***another trie*** called FileRoot in contractJSON. each member need to pay tau to relay nodes from time to time, or provide seeding service as compenstion. several IPFS relay nodes can belong to one TAU address. Tau will use ipfs node private key to proof that relation in txJSON profile. For now, the relay service is free. 


### B. Collect votings from peers: this process has two modes: miner and non-miner: 

#### B1. non-mining users, which are on battery power or telecome data service. 
0. release android wake-lock and wifi-lock
1. random walk to next followed chain id; random walk until connect to a next relay using Kademlia and TAU chain info; 
2. through relay, randomly request a chainPeer (get chainPeerIPFSaddr) for the future receipt state root candidate according to CBC (correct by construction); 
```
graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=contractJSON)); 
// when CID is NULL,  - 0 means the relay will request futureContractReceiptStateRoot from the peer via tcp
```
3. traverse mutable range history states
```
stateroot = futureContractReceiptStateRoot
(*) 
hamt_get(stateroot, "contractJSON");
stateroot= contractJSON/SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot
goto (*) until the mutable range; // 
goto step (2); 
```
when connection timeout or hit any error, go to step(1)
4. accounting the new voting, update the CBC safety root: levelDB_update(SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot, voted SAFETY), 
5. build a future contractReceiptState; check B2(miner)- step 5.
6. then go to step (1).


#### B2. mining user, which requires wifi and power plugged, while missing wifi or plug will switch to non-mining mode B1. 

0. turn on android wake-lock and wifi-lock
1. random walk to next chain id; random walk until connect to a next relay; 
2. through relay, randomly request a chainPeer (get chainPeerIPFSaddr) for the future receipt state root candidate according to CBC (correct by construction); 
```
graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=contractJSON)); 
// when CID is NULL,  - 0 means the relay will request futureContractReceiptStateRoot from the peer via tcp
```
3. traverse mutable range history states from the peer and keep accounting of the ContractReceiptStateRoot
```
(*) 
hamt_get(stateroot, "contractJSON");
stateroot= contractJSON/SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot
goto (*) until the mutable range; // 
goto step (2); 
```
when connection timeout or hit any error, go to step(1)
4. accounting the new voting, update the CBC safety root: levelDB_update(SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot, voted SAFETY), 
// initial voting done with a new safety
5. predict new future contract. 
```
//TAUminerImorpheus..x is an exmple of TAU miner address belong to imorpheus

// 3. FileRoot=hamp_flush_put()
// 4. return FileRoot and m to transaction Json.

```
* generate key 1 for hamp_add(contractJSON, X);
Put the all new generated states into  cbor block, generate ContractReceiptStateRoot = hamt_put(cbor); // this is the  return to requestor for future state prediction, it is a block.cid

#### contract execute results
##### output coinbase tx

* generate Tserver..xNounceWitnessJSON := {list of Tsenders in the block}

6. random walk until connect to a next relay
through graphrelaySync randomly request a chainPeer (get chainPeerIPFSaddr) for the future receipt state root candidate 
```
graphRelaySync( Relay, peerID, chainID, null, selector(field:=contractJSON)); 
```
7. mining by following the most difficult chain: if received futureContractReceiptStateRoot/ContractJSON shows a more difficult chain, then verify this chain's transactions for ONEWEEK
8. If verification succesful, levelDB_update(SafetyContractReceiptStateRoot, futureContractReceiptStateRoot), go to step (5) to get a new state prediction; Else go to step (6)
9. if network-disconnected from internet 48 hours, go to step (1).

### C. File Downloader
```
input (File root); // this is for single thread download
```
1. from Fileroot, find nouce, loop the File nounce, find contractJSON/msgTx/IPFS peers id;
{ random walk on all relays
```
graphRelaySync(relay, chainID, chainPeerIPFSID, File, selector(field:=section 1..m))
```
until finish all relays or find the chainPeer
}

* The download payment structure is charge TAUcoin per graphRelaysync block from TAUnodes. Therefore, the more peers paralell connections, the fast it is, the more expensive. 

# II. TAU Chain
no file attament, functions are chain registration, relay registration, relay payment.
